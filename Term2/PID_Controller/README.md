# **PID Controller Project** 

### In this project, I implemented a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track.

### Overview
Using the cross track error (CTE) and the speed (mph) provided by the Udacity simulator, I computed the appropriate steering angle necessary for the vehicle to traverse the track. Compare this method to the deep learning technique used to drive the car around the track in my [Behavioral Cloning project](https://github.com/jissac/SDCND/tree/master/Term1/Behavioral_Cloning).
