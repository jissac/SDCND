# **PID Controller Project** 

### In this project, I implemented a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track.

## Overview
Using the cross track error (CTE) and the speed (mph) provided by the Udacity simulator, I computed the appropriate steering angle necessary for the vehicle to traverse the track. Compare this method to the deep learning technique used to drive the car around the track in my [Behavioral Cloning project](https://github.com/jissac/SDCND/tree/master/Term1/Behavioral_Cloning).

## Control
Control is how we use the steering, throttle, and brakes to make the car go where we want it to go - a PID controller is a type of feedback controller that uses past, present, and future error to control a desired system. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkfEZmsQqiA) for a good intuition about how a PID controller works.
