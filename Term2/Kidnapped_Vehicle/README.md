# **Kidnapped Vehicle Project** 


### In this project, I implemented a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. The particle filter is given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter also gets observation and control data.

### Overview
The robot has been 'kidnapped' and transported to a new location. Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data. Given this information, 

The following files are included in the 'src' directory:
