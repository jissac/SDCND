# Term 1
### Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion
In this term, I applied computer vision and deep learning techniques on automotive problems 
by teaching the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angles, etc. based on camera data.

## Projects
- [Lane finding][1] 
- [Advanced Lane Finding][2]
- [Traffic Sign Classifier][3]
- Behavioral Cloning
- Extended Kalman Filters
