# Term 1
### Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion
In this term, we apply Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems 
by teaching the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more only based on camera data.

## Projects
- [Lane finding][1] 
- [Advanced Lane Finding][2]
- Traffic Sign Classifier
- Behavioral Cloning
- Extended Kalman Filters
