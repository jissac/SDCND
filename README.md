# SDCND
Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree

## Term 1: [Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion][7]
In this term, I applied computer vision and deep learning techniques on automotive problems 
by teaching the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angles, etc. based on camera data. Projects in Python, TensorFlow, and C++

### Projects
- [Lane finding][1] 
- [Advanced Lane Finding][2]
- [Traffic Sign Classifier][3]
- [Behavioral Cloning][4]
- [Extended Kalman Filters][5]

## Term 2: [Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration][8]
In this term, I used camera, radar, lidar, and GPS sensor data to localize and control the vehicle. Next, I applied path planning to get the vehicle to a specified location. Projects in Python, C++.
