# SDCND
Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree

## Term 1: [Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion][7]
In this term, I applied computer vision and deep learning techniques on automotive problems 
by teaching the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angles, etc. based on camera data.

## Projects
- [Lane finding][1] 
- [Advanced Lane Finding][2]
- [Traffic Sign Classifier][3]
- [Behavioral Cloning][4]
- [Extended Kalman Filters][5]

## Term 2: [Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration][8]
In this term, I used camera, radar, lidar, and GPS sensor data to localize and control the vehicle. Next, I applied path planning to get the vehicle to a specified location.

## Projects
- [Kidnapped Vehicle][1]
- [Highway Driving][2]
- [PID Controller][3]
- [Programming a Real Self-Driving Car][4]
